There's new [spreadsheet guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/)\n1. Might as well write some functions\n1. Other people are probably doing this\n\n::: notes\n* Context: the [Government Analysis Function](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/) created [new (and very good) guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/) for releasing statistics in spreadsheets.\n* None of the spreadsheets in my team were compliant. Colours, blank columns, multiple headers. Classic non-accessible stuff. Also the whole process was point-and-click before I joined.\n* Given multiple files staggered across releases, it made sense to create some reusable R functions to apply the new guidance consistently, which in turn meant it was worth while to create a package.\n* Att the time, there was the Python package 'gptables', but it hadn't yet been updated for the new guidance (it has been now) and there was no native R solution.\n:::\n\n## {.center .center data-background-image=\"assets/images/pegboard.png\" data-background-opacity=0.1}\n\n![](assets/images/website-a11ytables.png){alt='A screenshot of the documentation website for the R package called a11ytables. It has several sections of information about the purpose of the package, the license, the authors, and more.'}\n\n::: notes\n* And so the {a11ytables} package was created. Entirely for our own use at first, but I got the feeling it would have other interested parties.\n* What does it do? You give it your tables of data, along with some metadata like worksheet titles, and it automatically creates an xlsx spreadsheet that is (mostly!) compliant with the guidance.\n:::\n\n# {.center data-background-image=\"assets/images/pegboard.png\" data-background-opacity=0.1}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nremotes::install_github(\"co-analysis/a11ytables\")\n\na11ytables::create_a11ytable(\n  tab_titles,\n  sheet_types,\n  sheet_titles,\n  blank_cells,\n  sources,\n  tables\n) |>\n  a11ytables::generate_workbook() |>\n  openxlsx::saveWorkbook()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: notes\n:::\n\n## Success! {.center data-background-image=\"assets/images/pegboard.png\" data-background-opacity=0.1}\n\n* It did what I wanted it to do\n* I told people about it\n* It's in use across government\n\n::: notes\n* I used it to successfully create the spreadsheets we needed to release. The lowest bar!\n* I spoke to some targeted groups that might find it useful: bot internally (i.e. at an NHS-R webinar, at a GSS Champions quarterly meeting, to a Scottish Government R conference) and externally (i.e. a talk at EARL conference 2022, blog posts, social media). It's referenced now from the Analysis Function [spreadsheet guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/further-resources-for-releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/).\n* It's not perfect, but the package is now in use across a number of organisations (Co, MoJ, ONS, DfT, Scot Gov, etc)\n:::\n\n## Uhoh... {.center data-background-image=\"assets/images/pegboard.png\" data-background-opacity=0.1}\n\n* The (only) maintainer left the org!\n* Should {a11ytables2} exist?\n* Where should these things live?\n\n::: notes\n* This section was about me sharing my wisdom, but actully I'd like you to share yours.\n* Maybe the {a11ytables} package could change GitHub organisation? Need to think about licensing, broken URLs, burden on new owner.\n* Could ask Cabinet Office to archive the original {a11ytables} and clearly signpost this in the README, then communicate widely about the new package and target known users.\n* Another example is the {fingertipsR} package, which was removed from CRAN. URLs have broken, search engines show the 'removed from CRAN' page high in the rankings.\n:::\n\n# A resolution {.center data-background-image=\"assets/images/pegboard-invert.png\" data-background-opacity=0.1}\n\n::: notes\n:::\n\n## 1.

Maybe it needs a hammer. Where can I find one?\n* Yo, this is a _metaphor_.\n\n:::\n\n## {background-image=\"assets/images/cesar-carlevarino-aragon-NL_DF0Klepc-unsplash.jpg\"}\n\n::: footer\n<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@carlevarino?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Cesar Carlevarino Aragon</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/NL_DF0Klepc?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>\n:::\n\n::: notes\n* Future state?\n* What if we could organise and arrange these tools so everyone can more easily find and use them?\n* Fittingly, we have some empty spots to be filled in this image and also some tools that fill a spot, but don't quit fit the spot.
