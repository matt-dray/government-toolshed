## tl;dr {.center data-background-image="assets/images/pegboard.png" data-background-opacity=0.1}

1. Make modular, shareable tools
2. Talk about them
3. Set them free

## Challenge {.center data-background-image="assets/images/pegboard.png" data-background-opacity=0.1}

1. There's new spreadsheet guidance
1. We need to redesign our spreadsheets
1. There are lots of them

## Solution {.center data-background-image="assets/images/pegboard.png" data-background-opacity=0.1}

1. It'll be easier if I write an R package
1. Has anyone done this already?
1. I'll get it in the open

## Success {.center data-background-image="assets/images/pegboard.png" data-background-opacity=0.1}

* Is being used across government
* Was well advertised
* Has decent documentation

::: notes
* I was already building this tool for my team, but recognised a wider need given the Analysis Function's updated spreadsheets guidance and a lack of native R support.
* Spoke about it internally (i.e. at an NHS-R webinar, at a GSS Champions quarterly meeting, to a Scottish Government R conference) and externally (i.e. a talk at EARL conference 2022, blog posts, social media). It's referenced now from the Analysis Function spreadshset guidance.
* It's not perfect, but the package is now in use across a number of organisations.

## Uhoh {.center data-background-image="assets/images/pegboard.png" data-background-opacity=0.1}

* The (only) maintainer left the org!
* Should {a11ytables2} exist?
* Where should these things live?

::: notes
* Maybe the {a11ytables} package could change GitHub organisation? Need to think about licensing, broken URLs, burden on new owner.
* Could ask Cabinet Office to archive the original {a11ytables} and clearly signpost this in the README, then communicate widely about the new package and target known users.
* Another example is the {fingertipsR} package, which was removed from CRAN. URLs have broken, search engines show the 'removed from CRAN' page high in the rankings.

# A resolution {.center data-background-image="assets/images/pegboard-invert.png" data-background-opacity=0.1}

## 1. Think sustainably {.center data-background-image="assets/images/pegboard.png" data-background-opacity=0.1}

* Build modular things
* Write good documentation
* Plan for your loss

## 2. Advertise {.center data-background-image="assets/images/pegboard.png" data-background-opacity=0.1}

* You need momentum
* Show it off
* Answer questions, encourage collaborators

::: notes
:::

## 3. Centralise {.center data-background-image="assets/images/pegboard.png" data-background-opacity=0.1}

* Work together, avoid duplication
* Encourage institutional ownership
* Build a toolshed, they will come?
